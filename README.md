### Details
* What is the Fibonacci sequence?

* The Fibonacci sequence is a set of integers that starts with a zero, followed
  by a one, then by another one, and then by a series of steadily increasing numbers.
  The sequence follows the rule that each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.

>  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233
